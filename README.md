# python
A collection of different small projects as I re-learn Python.

### [Pizza Menu](../pizza_menu/pizza_menu.py)
This simple program displays a menu of different pizzas and their prices.

### [Personal Budget](../personal_budget/personal_budget.py)
This assignment was to create a 6-category personal budget, consisting of annual and monthly amounts. The goal of the assignment was to demonstrate string formatting. I converted this assignment from Python 2 to Python 3.
