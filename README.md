# python
A collection of different small projects as I re-learn Python. These assignments are from CS101 at BYU-Idaho; they were originally meant to be written in Python 2, but I got special permission to convert the assignments to Python 3, which is usually very similar, but occasionally very different.

### [Pizza Menu](https://github.com/PorterRyan/python/blame/main/pizza_menu/pizza_menu.py)
This simple program displays a menu of different pizzas and their prices.

### [Personal Budget](https://github.com/PorterRyan/python/blame/main/personal_budget/personal_budget.py)
This assignment was to create a 6-category personal budget, consisting of annual and monthly amounts. The goal of the assignment was to demonstrate string formatting. I converted this assignment from Python 2 to Python 3.

### [Personal Budget w/Inputs](https://github.com/PorterRyan/python/blame/main/personal_budget_inputs/personal_budget_inputs.py)
This is an adaptation of the previous assignment, but with user-defined categories instead of hard-coded categories. I went ahead and included a while loop because having only five categories just irked me.

### [Area Calculator](area_calculator/area_calculator.py)
A program that calculates the area of a circle, triangle, or rectangle.
